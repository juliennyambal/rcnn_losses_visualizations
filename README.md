# rcnn_losses_visualizations

This codes relies on the log generated by the training process of a Region based CNN (RCNN), which has a different architecture than a normal CNN. Still working on the training accuracy. I am currently using a zf architecture, which has at the top a cls-loss and bbox_loss layer. I will manage to have a training accuracy layer later on.

## Generate training logs

There are many ways out there to do it, but the commom one is to add at the end of you command line for training:
```bash
2>&1 | tee log/detection_log.txt
```
which basically redirecting the stdout and stderr to detection_log.txt.
